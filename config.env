# HOSTING
# =======
# The generated HTML documentation may be hosted in a branch of this
# repository, or in a branch of any other repository to which you
# have writing rights to. To select either, simply input the 
# characteristics of your branch or repository of choice.
#   + To STOP hosting in your branch of choice, you can
#       - Set "branch" to the empty string
#       - Comment the "branch" variable out
#     In the case of external repositories,
#       - Set "dest_gh_repository" to the empty string
#       - Comment the "dest_gh_repository" variable out
